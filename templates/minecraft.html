    Minecraft is a game where players can build three-dimensional worlds using blocks.
    One of the greatest things about Minecraft is its accessibility; it does not require a fancy gaming
    computer. Anyone with a Mac, Windows, or Linux PC can play!

    Don't have Minecraft? It's as easy as going to
    <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/">minecraft.org<a>
    and creating an account! Once you have an account, Minecraft costs $27 to own.
